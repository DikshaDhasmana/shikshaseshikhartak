# TODO: Increase Navbar Height

- [x] Edit `src/components/Navigation.tsx` to change the height class from `h-16` to `h-20`
- [ ] Run the development server to verify the navbar height increase (blocked: no space left on device)
- [ ] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes (pending verification)
