    <meta name="description" content="Shiksha Se Shikhar Tak is an NGO based in Delhi that works to provide free and quality education to underprivileged children, especially those from slums, economically weaker sections, and marginalized communities such as rag-pickers and children affected by substance abuse. Established around 2015–2016, the organization focuses on bridging educational gaps by offering primary education, distributing essential school supplies, and facilitating admissions of such children into formal schools. Alongside education, it also works on women empowerment by providing self-defense training, counselling, and skill-development support to girls and women, helping them become self-reliant. Through these initiatives, Shiksha Se Shikhar Tak strives to ensure that every child and woman, regardless of background, has the opportunity to learn, grow, and move towards a brighter and more secure future." />
